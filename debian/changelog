rog-core (0.13.0) focal; urgency=medium

  - Dbus command `LedWriteBytes` renamed to `SetKeyBacklight`
  - Dbus command `SetKeyBacklight` will now take a JSON string instead of an array of bytes
    + Example:
      ```
      {
      "Breathe": {
        "help": false,
          "colour": [
            254,
            5,
            171
          ],
          "colour2": [
            0,
            156,
            156
          ],
          "speed": "High"
        }
      }
      ```
      note that `help` is unused but required as a side-effect of using `gumdrop`
      for CLI.
  - Dbus signal `LedCancelEffect` renamed to `KeyBacklightChanged`
  - Config file is now in JSON format, and will store only the LED modes that a laptop
    supports rather than the whole set

  * Give different names for the bytearray arguments so that pydbus is not confused
  * Add org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.NoReply annotations

  * BREAKING CHANGE:
